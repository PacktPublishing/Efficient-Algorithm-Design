## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter10.

The code will look like the following:
```
def dp_fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = dp_fib(n-1, memo) + dp_fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
